Validator sets are often cycled to ensure varied participation and reduce the potential of centralization.
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): The consensus mechanism known as Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is made to withstand malevolent actors and preserve network integrity even when there are malfunctioning nodes present.
Modular Architecture
Core Consensus Layer: Block creation, transaction validation, and basic blockchain functions are handled by the core consensus layer.
AI Execution Layer: The AI Execution Layer is a specialized layer created to facilitate the effective operation of LLMs, AI models, and interaction with TensorFlow and Langchain.
Privacy Layer: Zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computing, and other privacy-preserving technologies are implemented at the privacy layer for sensitive AI calculations.
Connectivity Layer: The connectivity layer, which is necessary for many AI applications, allows for cross-chain communication and creates links with external data sources.
Developer Tools
AI-focused Smart Contract Libraries: Pre-built models and components for typical AI activities (such as federated learning, safe data sharing, and model deployment) in smart contracts.
WebAssembly Support (WASM): This might improve cross-compatibility and developer flexibility by providing WASM as a portable format for AI models.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Simplified IDEs that come pre-configured with debugging tools, blockchain interface, and AI libraries.



CloudSec

Effortless Node Deployment at Your Fingertips
Say goodbye to the complexities of node setup in the DeFi world. With our one-click deployment, choosing and launching your node is as simple as a single click. We handle the heavy lifting, from installation to troubleshooting, ensuring you don't get caught up with hours of research, package installations, or error fixes.



Don't let technical hurdles slow you down. Just click, deploy, and enjoy.

Onion Routing for Privacy
CloudSec leverages the principles of Onion Routing to provide users with a private and secure channel of communication. When a user makes a request, CloudSec encrypts the data and sends it across a network of intermediate nodes. Each node peels back a layer of encryption, making it highly challenging for a single node to identify the source and recipient of the data. This tiered encryption strategy ensures a high degree of anonymity and defense against traffic analysis.
